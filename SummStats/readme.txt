SummStats V 1.00e

Created from a combination of code from Planet VB. I made it for teachers (to prepare worksheets) and students (to check their answers, without buying an expensive TI calculator). Features include:


1.  Pasting in comma delimited data lists.
2.  Creating worksheet questions and answers
3.  Drag and drop OLE to Word and Wordpad.
4.  Saving to txt file and then converting to PDF.


Must give full credit to:

Original code created by Anton Venema in his Adv. Calc. Solver V 1.2.
PDF Producer written by Paras Chopra
Heap sort function by ? at http://www.Planet-Source-Code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=54770&lngWId=1
Additional features added by me (Eddie Bole).

I'm still learning VB6, so I take very little credit. For me, this project has been a bit of an adventure. I'm sure that the code and the GUI could be greatly improved, but anyhow I like playing around and fiddling with things to see how they work. I especially like trying to make math programs, to make like easier for people. I've got so many ideas, but need some help implementing them.



I would like to add some more features like:

1.  Checkboxes to select the lines of results displayed in the results textboxes.
2.  Adding a boxplot picture in the rich text box results section. 
    Anton Venema created a nice one in his adv. calc. solver V 1.2, but it does not display the whiskers and outliers accurately.
    No outliers gives some nice boxplot results. I'm not knocking his code, as other sections were well done.
3.  Better formatted text boxes with 2 columns and (with fields aligned better)
4.  How to get rid of the last comma in the sorted list?
5.  Listing the values of all of the outliers.
6.  How to print directly to pdf? Tried but failed. Looked at the Comprehensive Note Pad v 3.5.0 code, but could not work it out.
7.  Adding a skin feature
8.  Adding a graph paper maker
9.  Sending the results to Word, and Excel.
10. Unable to close down by clicking on the X up the top?


STill working out how to do these, and wouldn't mind a bit of help from whoever is kind enough to do so, especially on drawing the box plots and adding the checkboxes. My Email addy is at: edd_bole&yahoo.com.au    (that's if anyone has any spare time to help)


All I need is a MIRACLE... As that song goes...

And a good night's sleep.
